## 📖 Story
In a peaceful forest village, a strange mist corrupts the minds of its residents, turning them into enemy AI. One villager resists the transformation. With no weapons and no allies, they must escape the village while being hunted by their own friends.

To unlock the escape route, the player must collect **10 Magic Boxes**. Once collected, a **Magic Door** appears. Along the way, the player can use **Healing Mushrooms** to recover lost health. Stealth and evasion are key — the player cannot attack the enemies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Unreal Engine 5 (Third Person Template)  
- Blueprint Visual Scripting

## ✅ Conclusion
Through the development of **Villager Runaway**, we have learned and applied core game development principles using Unreal Engine 5, including blueprint scripting, AI behavior trees, environment design, and gameplay logic.

This project provided hands-on experience in designing a playable game prototype from scratch. We explored asset sourcing via Fab.com, and implemented features like collectibles, enemy AI detection, and a win/lose game loop.

In the future, we plan to expand this project with improved graphics, animations, multiplayer elements, and enhanced stealth mechanics. This proposal showcases our commitment to learning game development as a team and applying it creatively.
