# 🎮 Villager Runaway - Game Development Project Report

---

## 📖 Story

In a small peaceful village surrounded by forest, a mysterious force begins corrupting the villagers, transforming them into aggressive enemy AI. One lone villager remains unaffected. With no weapons and only stealth as a tool, the player must escape.

The only way out is through a **Magic Door** that unlocks after collecting **10 Magic Boxes** scattered around the village. The player must avoid detection, heal using **Mushrooms**, and survive long enough to escape. The challenge lies in navigating a place once called home, now filled with threats.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project provided deep insight into UE5 game development, AI logic, UI systems, and teamwork. By using Fab assets and Blueprint, we created a complete functional game prototype with a compelling story and immersive gameplay.

We now have hands-on experience in:
- AI perception and behavior
- Event-based blueprint scripting
- UI feedback for player actions
- Game balance with non-combat tension

The project taught us how to turn a small concept into an engaging gameplay loop—and laid the foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
